// What is the meaning of JSX?

// JSX is the abbreviation of JavaScript XML. It is a file that is used in React to bring out the essence of JavaScript to React and use it for its advantages.

// It even includes bringing out HTML and the easy syntax of JavaScript. This ensures that the resulting HTML file will have high readability, thereby relatively increasing the performance of the application.

// Consider the following example of a JSX:

render(){

return(

<div>

<h1> Hello Intellipaat learners!</h1>

</div>

);
