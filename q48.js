// What is React Fiber?

// React Fiber is a new engine in React. It is the reimplementation core algorithm in React 16.

// The main goal of React Fiber is to ensure that there are incremental rendering facilities for the virtual DOM. This increases efficiency when rendering animations, gestures, etc. and also helps in assigning priority to updates based on the requirement, thereby increasing overall efficiency.
