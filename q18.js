// What is the meaning of Redux?

// Redux is used to store the state of the application in a single entity. This simple entity is usually a JavaScript object. Changing states can be done by pushing out actions from the application and writing corresponding objects for them that are used to modify the states.

// For example:

const state = {

first_name: 'John',

last_name : 'Kelly',

age: 25

}
