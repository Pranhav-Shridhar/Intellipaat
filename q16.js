// What is the meaning of create-react-app in React?

// The create-react app in React is a simple command-line interface (CLI) that is used in the creation of React applications, which have no build configuration.

// All tools are pre-configured when using the CLI, and this allows users to focus on the code more than on dependencies to develop the application.

// The following syntax is used to start a simple project in React:

//npm create-react-app my-app
