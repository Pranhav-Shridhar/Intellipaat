// How does rendering work in React?

// Rendering is an important aspect of React as every single component must be rendered. This is done using the render() function. Once the function is called, it returns an element that represents a DOM component.

// It is also possible to render more than one HTML element at a time by enclosing the HTML tags and passing them through the render function.
