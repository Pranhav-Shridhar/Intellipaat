// What are the three phases of a component life cycle in React?

// The following are the three phases of a component life cycle:

// Initial rendering: This is the phase that involves the beginning of the journey of the component to the DOM.
// Update: Here, the component can be updated and rendered again if required after it gets added to the DOM.
// Unmounting: The final phase involves the destruction of the component and its eventual removal from the DOM.
