// How is routing in React different from conventional routing?

// Differences between the conventional routing and the routing in React can be shown using the following aspects:

// Pages: Each view is considered as a new file in conventional routing while it is considered as a single HTML entity in React.
// Navigation: In conventional routing, users have to move across web pages for viewing. In React, the views are not refreshed as objects are re-issued to create new views.
